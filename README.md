# NY Times Top Stories

### Summary
This 8-hour project was a challenge to use the NY Times Top Stories API to generate a news reader in React. The goal was to provide a user a display of headlines, a detailed view of individual articles, and a means of searching or filtering the stories, as well as to make the app responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
