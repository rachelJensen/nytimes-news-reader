# NY Times Top Stories

### Summary
This 8-hour project was a challenge to use the NY Times Top Stories API to generate a news reader in React. The goal was to provide a user a display of headlines, a detailed view of individual articles, and a means of searching or filtering the stories, as well as to make the app responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile. With limited time, I decided to focus on smooth user experience across screen sizes and accessibility. The desktop and mobile display are the same--a view that shows both the list of headlines and a selected article--however, for mobile, the article view is openable/closable so a user doesn't have to scroll to get from headlines to article. I used semantic HTML, and Lighthouse and tab-testing to make sure the app is navigable and easy to read.
